	* xrtransform.c (_XrTransformDistance):
	(_XrTransformPoint): changed to use individual X/Y arguments
	rather tha an XPointDouble. This improves readability since
	_XrTransformDistance is now always called with arguments of dx/dy
	rather than pt.x/pt.y.

	* xrpath.c (_XrPathMoveTo):
	(_XrPathLineTo):
	(_XrPathCurveTo):
	(_XrPathClosePath): replaced public _XrPathAdd with explicit named
	functions. This cleans up the implementation since _XrPathAdd,
	which is unsafe with respect to argument consistency, is now
	private. Also, since the _XrGState now maintains the current
	point, I dropped all relative path operators from the XrPath data
	structures.

	* xrgstate.c (_XrGStateMoveTo):
	(_XrGStateLineTo):
	(_XrGStateCurveTo):
	(_XrGStateRelMoveTo):
	(_XrGStateRelLineTo):
	(_XrGStateRelCurveTo): Replaces _XrGStateAddPathOp and
	_XrGStateAddUnaryPathOp with explicit named functions for each
	operator type. This change introduces the current point state into
	the XrGState structure rather than postponing its calculation
	until path interpretation.

	* xrgstate.c (_XrGStateSetDrawable):
	(_XrGStateSetVisual):
	(_XrGStateSetFormat):
	(_XrGStateSetOperator):
	(_XrGStateSetRGBColor):
	(_XrGStateSetTolerance):
	(_XrGStateSetAlpha):
	(_XrGStateSetFillRule):
	(_XrGStateSetLineWidth):
	(_XrGStateSetLineCap):
	(_XrGStateSetLineJoin):
	(_XrGStateSetMiterLimit):
	(_XrGStateTranslate):
	(_XrGStateScale):
	(_XrGStateRotate):
	(_XrGStateConcatMatrix):
	(_XrGStateNewPath): : Added XrStatus return values to many
	functions -- just for consistency, these functions can not return
	errors in any case.

	* xr.c (XrShowText): Started to ass XrShowText, (still not functional)

	* xr.c (XrSetFillRule): Added support to set fill rule.

	* xrtraps.c (_XrTrapsTessellatePolygon): Fix for polygon with
	multiple sub-polygons that are disjoint in Y.

	* Xr.h: Renamed xrpicture.c to xrsurface.c as part of the move.
	Added XrSetFormat, XrSetOperator, XrSetLineCap, XrSetLineJoin, and
	XrSetMiterLimit, (although the line style drawing code is not all
	in place yet).

	* xrpath.c (XrPathLineTo): Changed LineTo semantics to be the same
	as MoveTo if there was no previous MoveTo.

	* xrtraps.c: Added tessellation code, (lifted from
	XRenderCompositeDoublePoly which can now disappear).

	* xrgstate.c: Changed stroke code to incrementally build a list of
	trapezoids rather than forming one giant polygonal outline and
	rendering that. This should be more efficient.
	(_XrGStateFillPath): Now uses Xr's own tessellation along with
	XcCompositeTrapezoids.

	* Xr.h: Moved all of Xr away from Xrender to the new Xc library.

	* xrsurface.c: Renamed from xrpicture.c, (part of the move from
	XRender to Xc).

	* Started keeping a ChangeLog ;-)
