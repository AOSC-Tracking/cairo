	* Xr.h: Renamed xrpicture.c to xrsurface.c as part of the move.
	Added XrSetFormat, XrSetOperator, XrSetLineCap, XrSetLineJoin, and
	XrSetMiterLimit, (although the line style drawing code is not all
	in place yet).

	* xrpath.c (XrPathLineTo): Changed LineTo semantics to be the same
	as MoveTo if there was no previous MoveTo.

	* xrtraps.c: Added tessellation code, (lifted from
	XRenderCompositeDoublePoly which can now disappear).

	* xrgstate.c: Changed stroke code to incrementally build a list of
	trapezoids rather than forming one giant polygonal outline and
	rendering that. This should be more efficient.
	(_XrGStateFillPath): Now uses Xr's own tessellation along with
	XcCompositeTrapezoids.

	* Xr.h: Moved all of Xr away from Xrender to the new Xc library.

	* xrsurface.c: Renamed from xrpicture.c, (part of the move from
	XRender to Xc).

	* Started keeping a ChangeLog ;-)
